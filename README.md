# Soop

Soop is a small, interpreted language written in python

By the way, soop is still a developing language, and anything can change at any time, please use it at your own risk!

Soop will be ported over to C/C++ later on, so it can be a little faster....

## Quick Start
```
$ ./sl.py help
$ ./sl.py examples/hello.sl
```

## Goals
- [ ] Turing complete
- [ ] Graphics
- [ ] Static type checking

## Future Goals
- [ ] Optimized
- [ ] Compiled to machine code or assembly
- [ ] Windows/MacOS compatable
